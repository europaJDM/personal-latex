Hello,

I have heard a lot of great things about VML by virtue of working in the technology industry in the Kansas City metro.  I am currently looking for a Java development position if one is available.  I would like to be considered for one if it becomes available in the future.

I have over 5 years of server-side development experience and have been working exclusively with the Java platform at my current position.  My primary professional focus is to continue bringing value and building expertise in Java and any related technologies.  I am looking to make a job change because the current project is moving to a different technology stack and replacing the Java application.

I am passionate about software development and looking for an environment where best practices are followed. I believe this type of environment is instrumental to delivering a high quality product.

I am currently located in Lenexa, KS but also considering relocation to the East. I am comfortable with covering my relocation expenses, if needed.

Sincerely,

Dmitry Kolesnikov
